        When merged, fieldManager.provinces need to be updated accordingly
        Their finances need to be merged as well!
        As of this writing we are managing the finances with the Overlay class that we display on top

* BUG: Cells that are left as a single cell after a split shouldn't contain a unit or an object in it.We simply need to remove it/them, make them provinceless \/
    This seems a bit more nuanced.

            Unit unit = unitList.get(i);
            if (isCurrentTurn(unit.getFraction()) && unit.currentHex.numberOfFriendlyHexesNearby() == 0) {
                fieldManager.killUnitByStarvation(unit.currentHex);

    * If the object was a town, we left a tree there at the end of the turn. \/

* When a split happens, we were assigning the old balance of the province to the first suitable new province.   \/
We now changed it to a province where the income is also the highest. This is the behaviour of the original game.
