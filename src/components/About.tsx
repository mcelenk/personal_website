            <p>
                Hey, there! My name’s Mustafa Çelenk. I'm a software engineer with a passion for indie 2d (and isometric) games (currently diving deep into HTML canvas implementations).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my space to share thoughts, projects, and insights as I journey through my field. Whether it’s a new technology, a creative project, or just something cool I stumbled upon, I try to write here regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, you might find me watching football matches, lifting weights or reading sci-fi.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:mcelenk@dottilde.com">email</a>.
